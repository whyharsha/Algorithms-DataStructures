# Algorithms and Data Structures

Based off of the [OCW Course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/index.htm) including the recitation videos that were kindly uploaded, but also additional study from numerous Youtube tutors, tutorial websites, Stackoverflow and even, Quora, on occasion. My sincere thanks for all your efforts and hard work.
